This file describes three stand-alone utility programs that come
with Borland Pascal: TOUCH, GREP, and BINOBJ.

Note: For information regarding the MAKE utility, see the Tools
and Utilities Guide.

======================
 1. The TOUCH Utility
======================

There are times when you want to force a particular target file
to be recompiled or rebuilt, even though no changes have been
made to its sources. One way to do this is to use the TOUCH
utility included with Borland Pascal. TOUCH changes the date and
time of one or more files to the current date and time, making it
"newer" than the files that depend on it.

To force a target file to be rebuilt, "touch" one of the files
that target depends on. To touch a file (or files), enter

   touch filename [ filename ... ]

at the DOS prompt. TOUCH will then update the file's creation
date(s).

Once you do this, you can invoke MAKE to rebuild the touched
target file(s).


=====================
 2. The GREP Utility
=====================

GREP is a powerful search utility that can look for text in
several files at once.

The command-line syntax for GREP follows:

   GREP [options] searchstring [filespec ... ]

where options consists of one or more single characters preceded
by a hyphen, searchstring defines the pattern to search for, and
filespec is the file specification. filespec tells GREP which
files (or groups of files) to search; it can be an explicit file
name or a generic file name incorporating the DOS wildcards (?
and *). You can also enter a path as part of filespec; if you use
filespec without a path, GREP only searches the current
directory. If you don't specify filespec, input to GREP must be
specified by redirecting stdin or piping.


 The GREP Switches
===================

In the command line, options are one or more single characters
preceded by a hyphen (-). Each individual character is a switch
that you can turn on or off: type the plus symbol (+) after a
character to turn the option on, or type a hyphen (-) after the
character to turn the option off.

The default is on (the + is implied): for example, -R means the
same thing as -R+. You can list multiple options individually
like this: -I -D -L). Or you can combine them like this: -ILD or
-IL -D, and so on). It's all the same to GREP.

Here is a list of the switches and their meanings:

   -C   Count only: Only a count of matching lines is printed.
        For each file that contains at least one matching line,
        GREP prints the file name and a count of the number of
        matching lines. Matching lines are not printed.

   -D   Directories: For each filespec specified on the command
        line, GREP searches for all files that match the file
        specification, both in the directory specified and in all
        subdirectories below the specified directory. If you give
        a filespec without a path, GREP assumes the files are in
        the current directory.

   -I   Ignore case: GREP ignores upper/lowercase differences
        (case folding). GREP treats all letters a-z as being
        identical to the corresponding letters A-Z in all
        situations.

   -L   List match files: Only the name of each file containing a
        match is printed. After GREP finds a match, it prints the
        file name and processing immediately moves on to the next
        file.

   -N   Numbers: Each matching line that GREP prints is preceded
        by its line number.

   -O   UNIX output format: Changes the output format of matching
        lines to support more easily the UNIX style of
        command-line piping. All lines of output are preceded by
        the name of the file which contained the matching line.

   -R   Regular expression search: The text defined by
        searchstring is treated as a regular expression instead
        of as a literal string.

   -U   Update options: GREP will combine the options given on
        the command line with its default options and write these
        to the GREP.COM file as the new defaults. (In other
        words, GREP is self-configuring.) This option allows you
        to tailor the default option settings to your own taste.

   -V   Non-match: Only non-matching lines are printed. Only
        lines that do not contain the search string are
        considered to be non-matching lines.

   -W   Word search: Text found which matches the regular
        expression will be considered a match only if the
        character immediately preceding and following cannot be
        part of a word. The default word character set includes
        A-Z, 9-0, and the underbar (_). An alternate form of this
        option allows you to specify the set of legal word
        characters. Its form is -W[set], where set is any valid
        regular expression set definition. If alphabetic
        characters are used to define the set, the set will
        automatically be defined to contain both the upper and
        lower case values for each letter in the set, regardless
        of how it is typed, even if the search is case-sensitive.
        If the -W option is used in combination with the -U
        option, the new set of legal characters is saved as the
        default set.

   -Z   Verbose: GREP prints the file name of every file
        searched. Each matching line is preceded by its line
        number. A count of matching lines in each file is given,
        even if the count is zero.

Several of these options are in direct conflict with each other.
In these cases, the following order applies (the first one is the
one that takes precedence):

   -Z   -L   -C   -N

Each occurrence of an option overrides the previous definition:
Its state reflects the way you last set it. At any given time,
each option can only be on or off.

You can install your preferred default setting for each option in
GREP.COM with the -U option. For example, if you want GREP to
always do a verbose search (-Z on), you can install it with the
following command:

   GREP -U -Z


 How to Search Using GREP
==========================

The value of searchstring defines the pattern GREP will search
for.  A search string can be either a (via the -R switch) or a
literal string. In regular expressions, operators govern the
search; literal strings have no operators.

You can enclose the search string in quotation marks to prevent
spaces and tabs from being treated as delimiters. Matches will
not cross line boundaries (a match must be contained in a single
line).

When the -R switch is used, the search string is treated as a
regular expression (as opposed to a literal expression), and the
following symbols take on special meanings:

   ^   A caret at the start of the expression matches the start
       of a line.

   $   A dollar sign at the end of the expression matches the end
       of a line.

   .   A period matches any character.

   *   An expression followed by an asterisk wildcard matches
       zero or more occurrences of that expression: fo* matches
       f, fo, foo, etc.

   +   An expression followed by a plus sign matches one or more
       occurrences of that expression: fo+ matches fo, foo, etc.,
       but not f.

   []  A string enclosed in brackets matches any character in
       that string, but no others. If the first character in the
       string is a caret (^), the expression matches any
       character except the characters in the string. For
       example, [xyz] matches x, y, and z, while [^xyz] matches a
       and b, but not x or y. A range of characters can be
       specified by two characters separated by a hyphen (-).
       These can be combined to form expressions like [?a-bd-z]
       to match ? and any letter except c.

   \   The backslash "escape character" tells GREP to search for
       the literal character that follows it. For example, \.
       matches a period instead of any character.

   Note: Four characters (?, +, *, and .) do not have any special
   meaning when used in a set. The character ^ is only treated
   specially if it immediately follows the beginning of the set
   (that is, immediately after the [).

Any ordinary character not mentioned in this list matches that
character. A concatenation of regular expressions is a regular
expression.


 Examples Using GREP
=====================

The following examples assume all options default to off.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Search String   grep -n function dirdemo.pas

Finds       File DIRDEMO.PAS:
            51        LessFunc = function(X, Y: DirPtr): Boolean;
            60      function NumStr(N, D: Integer): String;
            73      function LessName(X, Y: DirPtr): Boolean;
            78      function LessSize(X, Y: DirPtr): Boolean;
            83      function LessTime(X, Y: DirPtr): Boolean;

Remarks     Finds all functions in the file DIRDEMO.PAS. The -N
            tells GREP to precede each matched line with its line
            number.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Search String   grep {\$ dirdemo.pas

Finds       File DIRDEMO.PAS:
            {$I-,S-}
            {$M 8192,8192,655360}
            {$F+}
            {$F-}

Remarks     Finds all compiler directives in DIRDEMO.PAS. The \
            (backslash) preceding the $ is necessary. Without it,
            the $ would indicate the end of the line. All lines
            with { (curly bracket) as the last character would
            match this pattern and be printed out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Search String   grep -i "^ *function.*).*real" *.pas

Finds       File WORKERS.PAS:
            function RoundPay(Wages: Real): Real;

Remarks     Finds all lines that begin with zero or more spaces
            followed by the word function, followed by any string
            of zero or more characters, followed by a
            parenthesis, followed by another string of zero or
            more characters, followed by the word Real, and
            ignores case. The net effect is to search for all
            functions returning a Real. See if you can think of
            other ways to do this.

            The double quotes are necessary because of the space
            in the pattern string. The quotes tell the DOS
            command-line processor to treat the intervening
            characters as a single argument. Without the quotes,
            DOS will think the search string is actually two
            arguments, and GREP will think that everything after
            ^ (the caret character) refers to file names, and
            will complain

            No files matching: *FUNCTION.*).*.


=======================
 3. The BINOBJ Utility
=======================

A utility program called BINOBJ.EXE has been added to convert any
file to an .OBJ file so it can be linked into a pascal program as
a "procedure." This is useful if you have a binary data file that
must reside in the code segment or is too large to make into a
typed constant array. For example, you can use BINOBJ with the
Graph unit to link the graphics driver or font files directly
into your .EXE file. Then, to use your graph program, you need
only have the .EXE file (see the example BGILINK.PAS).

BINOBJ takes three parameters:

   BINOBJ  <source[.BIN]>  <destination[.OBJ]>  <public name>

where source is the binary file to convert, destination is the
name of the .OBJ to be produced, and public name is the name of
the procedure as it will be declared in your pascal program.

The following example, the procedure ShowScreen, takes a pointer
as a parameter and moves 4000 bytes of data to screen memory. The
file called MENU.DTA contains the image of the main menu screen
(80 * 25 * 2 = 4000 bytes).

Here's a simple (no error-checking) version of MYPROG.PAS:

   program MyProg;

   uses Crt;

   procedure ShowScreen(ScreenData : Pointer);
   { Display a screenful of data--no error-checking! }
   var
     ScreenSegment: Word;

   begin
     if (Lo(LastMode) = 7) then      { Mono? }
       ScreenSegment := $B000
     else
       ScreenSegment := $B800;
     Move(ScreenData^,               { From pointer }
      Ptr(ScreenSegment, 0)^,        { To video memory }
      4000);                         { 80 * 25 * 2 }
   end;

   var
     MenuP : Pointer;
     MenuF : file;
   begin
     Assign(MenuF, 'MENU.DTA');      { Open screen data file }
     Reset(MenuF, 1);
     GetMem(MenuP, 4000);            { Allocate buffer on heap }
     BlockRead(MenuF, MenuP^, 4000); { Read screen data }
     Close(MenuF);
     ShowScreen(MenuP);              { Display screen }
   end.


The screen data file (MENU.DTA) is opened and then read into a
buffer on the heap. Both MYPROG.EXE and MENU.DTA must be present
at run-time for this program to work. You can use BINOBJ to
convert MENU.DTA to an .OBJ file (MENUDTA.OBJ) and tell it to
associate the data with a procedure called MenuData. Then you can
declare the fake external procedure MenuData, which actually
contains the screen data. Once you link in the .OBJ file with the
$L compiler directive, MenuData will be 4000 bytes long and
contain your screen data. First, run BINOBJ on MENU.DTA:

   binobj MENU.DTA MENUDTA MenuData

The first parameter, MENU.DTA, shows a familiar file of screen
data; the second, MENUDTA, is the name of the .OBJ file to be
created (since you didn't specify an extension, .OBJ will be
added). The last parameter, MenuData, is the name of the external
procedure as it will be declared in your program. Now that you've
converted MENU.DTA to an .OBJ file, here's what the new
MYPROG.PAS looks like:

   program MyProg;

   uses Crt;

   procedure ShowScreen(ScreenData : Pointer);
   { Display a screenful of data--no error checking! }
   var
     ScreenSegment: Word;
   begin
     if (Lo(LastMode) = 7) then             { Mono? }
       ScreenSegment := $B000
     else
       ScreenSegment := $B800;
     Move(ScreenData^,                      { From pointer }
      Ptr(ScreenSegment, 0)^,               { To video memory }
      4000);                                { 80 * 25 * 2 }
   end;

   procedure MenuData; external;
   {$L MENUDTA.OBJ }
   begin
     ShowScreen(@MenuData);                 { Display screen }
   end.

Notice that ShowScreen didn't change at all, and that the ADDRESS
of your procedure is passed using the @ operator.
