                    Thank you for choosing our compiler!


Introduction
------------

The TMT Pascal compiler is a fast compiler for the Pascal language.
The compiler emits 32-bit code and supports many language extensions
from Borland Pascal (BP), as well as more powerful extensions.

Ordering the TMT Pascal compiler
--------------------------------

   The Lite version of the TMT Pascal compiler is not freeware, although it
   is free for personal use. You have to pay a registration fee of $49, to
   use the compiler for commercial applications.

   A license will get you the current version of the compiler plus all
   updates as they are released until the next major version.

Compiler installation and running
---------------------------------

   The Pascal distribution is contained in the tmtpXXXd.zip archive.
   (XXX being the version number) Please read the license.doc file before
   installing the compiler.

   Follow these instructions to run the installation process.

      - create the \TMTPL directory on one of your drives (we will call
        it the x: drive) using the command:
            x> md TMTPL

      - copy the tmtpXXXd.zip file into the TMTPL directory:

            x> copy  tmtpXXXd.zip x:\TMTPL
            x> x:
            x> cd \TMTPL

      - run the PKUNZIP program to decompress the tmtpXXXd.zip

            x:\TMTPL> pkunzip -d tmtpXXXd

        (the switch "-d" unpacks with subdirectories)

      - modify the PATH statement in autoexec.bat, to include the
                x:\TMTPL\BIN
         subdirectory, if you so desire.

      - go to \TMTPL\SAMPLES\HELLO,
        compile the simple test program, "HELLO.PAS", and run it:

           x:\TMTPL> tmtpc hello
           x:\TMTPL> hello

      - read the entire manual.dos file before using the compiler for
        any "real" application development.

   Running the compiler:
   --------------------

  The compiler is invoked with the "tmtpc" command:

  tmtpc [switches] <main file>

  where the following switches can be used:

    -m   - make modified units (default option)
    -b   - build the whole program
    -c   - single compilation (without linkage)

After that the suite of object files with .FPD extensions will be
established in the directory with the sources, and the executable file
will be created in the current directory (if the switch -c is not set).

Out of memory message

If you receive message "not enough memory for compilation", you have to
either:

   - increase the amount of free extended memory (for example, decrease
     the "cash" of your hard disk), or
   - decrease the value of the EXEMAK and OBJMAX parameters in the
     configuration file.


Configuration file
------------------

Before compiling, the compiler reads the settings from the special file -
tmtp.cfg. It searches for this file at the beginning of the current directory and
then, if it doesn't find it, in the start directory.

The configuration file "tmtp.cfg" contains the compilation parameters:
one command per line. Empty lines are possible. Comment lines begin with
the ';' symbol.

The following parameters can be used in the tmtp.cfg:

    toggle settings:
       ac+/-      - Ada-style comments
       amd+/-     - AMD 3DNow! assmbler instructions
       cc+/-      - C/C++ style comments
       d+/-       - debug information
       i+/-       - then automatic input/output result checking
       l+/-       - local debug symbols
       map+/-     - the map file generation
       mmx+/-     - MMX assmbler instructions
       oa+/-      - objects and structures align
       optreg+/-  - the register optimization
       optfrm+/-  - the stack frame optimization
       opt+/-     - all optimization (optreg+ & optfrm+)
       p+/-       - open string params
       q+/-       - the overflow checking
       r+/-       - the range checking
       t+/-       - typed pointers
       tpo+/-     - typed Inc/Dec operations
       v+/-       - strict var checking
       w+/-       - the puting of warning messages
       x+/-       - extended syntax

    Default settings: a+, r-, i+, p+, t-, x+, b-, tpo+, map-, opt+, logo+,
                      mmx+, amd+, w+, oa-, d+, l+, q-, v+, ac-, cc+

    file path search specification:

       srcpath    <search_path> - specifies path for the source file search
       objpath    <search_path> - specifies path for the object file (.FPD)
                                  and STUBs search
       objimppath <search_path> - specifies path for the OBJ import file
                                  search by use of a $L directive


       pseudo-devices SYS: and SRC: can be used in the path line:

         SYS: means the TMTPC compiler directory,
         SRC: means the application program directory.

       defaults:  srcpath     src:;sys:
                  objpath     src:;sys:
                  objimppath  src:;sys:


    buffer size specification:

       objmax <size>    - specifies the size of the buffer for object
                          modules (fpd-files). This parameter must be
                          about one and a half times the size of the
                          largest fpd-file from the project.

       exemax <size>    - specifies the maximum size of the executable
                          module.

       defaults:   objmax 1024K
                   exemax 1024K

       These values are enough for ordinary work.  But if you receive
       a message about overflowing of these buffers, you'll have to
       increase them.  If you receive the message about unsufficient memory
       for the compilation, you can try to decrease them.

    stack size specification:

       stack <stack_size> - specifies size of the application stack
       default:    32K

    start up block (stub) name specification:

       stub  <stub_name>  - specifies the STUB name for the linker.

                            default: PMWSTUB.EXE

                            use the OBJPATH option to specify the seacrh path
                            for the stub files

    Symbol definition:

       def <symbol name>

       The following symbols are predefined:
           __TMT__ :    always
           __VER3__:    always for version 3.xx
           __DOS__ :    for DOS target

    error message format specification:

       errmw+ - specifies the MetaWare Pascal format of the error message:

                   E "HELLO.PAS" L4/C16: type mismatch

       errmw- - specifies BP-like format of the error message:

                   textcolor (lightred+'a');
                              
                   Error: HELLO.PAS (line 4, col 16): type mismatch

       This parameter allows use of the MultiEdit program as a shell
       when the errmw+ parameter is set.

       The default is:  errmw-

     Output of the TMTSTUB.EXE logo specification:

       logo+  -  enables output of the TMTSTUB logo during the running of
                 the emitted program.
       logo-  -  disables output of the TMTSTUB logo during the running of
                 the emitted program.

       The default is: logo+

Memory organization
-------------------

The segment registers are not used in the protected mode.  Instead all
address space is separated into 4Kb pages.

For example:

        procedure clr_video (filler: char);
           var i: integer;
        begin
           for i := 0 to 80*25-1 do
               mem [$B8000+i*2] := filler;
        end;

This procedure fills the video memory of the VGA adapter with the
filler symbol.

Note that the linear address $B8000 is used as the physical address - not
the segment address $B800.

Absolute memory addressing Mem, MemW, MemL, and MemD pseudo-arrays may be
used in BP-compatible manner:

  var x: type absolute seg:offs
  Mem[seg:offs]

Here the effective address is computed as seg*16+offs. The Ptr(seg, offs)
function works similarly. The Seg(v) function still always returns 0. These
new functions should substantially simplify the conversion of the programs
that use absolute addressing.

Some another special variables are described in the SYSTEM unit.
The _psp variable contains the logical 32-bit address of the PSP of the
program, and the _environ variable contains the environment address.

Although you can access the interrupt vectors by using this method,
we do not suggest doing this.


    Also keep in mind that MS-DOS interrupt handlers use memory
    addresses in the 1st Mb of physical memory while your program
    and its data are loaded beyond the 1st Mb. TMTSTUB intercepts
    and correctly handles some, but not all, calls to MS-DOS.
    Thus, if you are using Intr() or MsDos() calls, or call MS-DOS from
    the assembler, you will need to modify your code.

Calling conventions
-------------------

Calling conventions match those in Borland Pascal with the following
differences:

     all parameters use 4 bytes on the stack, or a multiple of 4 (BP:2)

     all procedures must preserve the contents of registers ebx, ecx, edx,
     ds, and es!

     the direction bit should be cleared after exiting a procedure,
     if it has been modified by it.


Language syntax of TMT Pascal
-----------------------------

While the Language syntax of TMT Pascal is in general compatible with BP 7.0,
there are some differences. Below is the list, divided into three groups:
limitations, extensions, and incompatibilities.

   1. Limitations:

Not implemented are MARK and RELEASE.

The INLINE() operator in implemented in a partial form:
    INLINE (byte/byte/...);
(No references to variables/constants are allowed).

The import of object modules does not support all 32bit object formats.
We recommend using TASM which is fully supported, excepting
usage of SEG addresses.

   2. Extensions:

ADA-style comments are supported:  -- comment
For example:

      space := ' ';  -- initialize filler char

Almost everywhere where Pascal's syntax allows a type identifier, we
also allow a type descriptor. The compiler will produce a warning if you
use this feature.

!!! Keep in mind that the rules of type equivalence stay in force.

Procedural values contain the address of the local environment (frame).
Thus, any local procedures can be used in procedural values. Procedural
declarations in the style

    procedure p (function f (a:real):real); ...

are also realized.

The procedural value from a method of object can be obtained by
selecting this method from some object value (not from a type). The
parameters of this procedural value must match the parameters of the
method.  The invocation of such a procedural value is an invocation of the
corresponding method of the object.  The reference to the object is
transferred through the base of the procedural value.

You can use only global procedural values to initialize a type constant.

!!! Procedural values may be used only while the environment where
they were formed is still in existence.  Thus, for local procedures
-- until the exit from the block, in which they are described; for
methods -- while the underlying object still exists.

see also "incompatibilities."

With TMT Pascal you can use any statement as a procedure body,
except for the assignment and the procedure calls.

The RESULT variable in the body of such functions denotes the variable
that contains the return value.  The RESULT is of the function return type
and may be used as a variable without any restrictions.

With TMT Pascal you can enter the procedure body directly as a procedure
parameter.  The procedure or function header (if not specified) takes the
procedural parameter type.  If the procedure header is specified, the
procedure name is omitted.  Example:

function integral (function f (a:real):real; low, high, step: real): real;
begin ... end;

    ...
    writeln (integral (
         function (x:real):real; begin result := sqrt (x) end,
    0, 10, 0.1));

    writeln (integral (begin result := sqrt (a) end, 0, 10, 0.1));

    writeln (integral (
         function;        -- function keyword needed
             var x: real; -- for local declaration
         begin x := sqrt (a); result := x end,
    0, 10, 0.1));

    writeln (integral (
         declare;         -- other way
             var x: real; -- for local variable declaration
         begin x := sqrt (a); result := x end,
    0, 10, 0.1));

TMT Pascal allows exit from a local procedure to the one that contains it.
This feature is listed in the Pascal's ANSI standard but not realized in
BP. Together with procedural values, this is very useful for error handling:

Program test;
    Var on_eof: procedure;
    Function read_char: char;
        Var c: char;
    Begin
        If Eof (Input) Then on_eof;
        read (c);
        read_char := c;
    End;

    Procedure p;
        Label eof_reached;
        Procedure go_eof; Begin goto eof_reached; End;
    Begin
        on_eof := go_eof;
        While True Do Write (read_char);
    Eof_reached:
        Writeln ('*** EOF ***');
        on_eof := NIL;
    End;

Begin
    p;
End.

Restriction: BREAK and CONTINUE operators cannot be used for exit
from a procedure. Use GOTO instead.

Example:

        for i := 1 to 10 do
            writeln (integral (  -- function integral from previous example
                if a < 0 then break else result := sqrt (a), -- incorrect
            i, i + 1, 0.01));

        declare
            label L;
        begin
            for i := 1 to 10 do
                writeln (integral (
                    if a < 0 then goto L else result := sqrt (a), -- correct
                i, i + 1, 0.01));
        L: end;

Functions may return any values of any type, including structures and arrays.

The new operator DECLARE

   DECLARE
       <declaration part>
   BEGIN
       <statement list>
   END

allows one to describe local variables and procedures anywhere in the
program.  Use of "DECLARE" leads to more readable programs and conserves
the stack space.

Functions length, chr, ord may be used as variables. For example:

         chr (i) := ' ';   is equivalent to   i := ord (' ');
         ord (c) := 255;   is equivalent to   c := chr (255);
         length (s) := 10; is equivalent to   s [0] := chr (10);


The main program may contain "interface" and "implementation".
This allows access to the variables of the main program from other
modules:

    program Test;
    interface
    var
      global: Integer;
    implementation
    uses Unit_test;
    begin
       Unit_test.write;
    end.

    unit Unit_test;
    interface
    procedure Write_global;
    implementation
    uses Test;
      procedure Write_global;
      begin
          Write(test.global);
      end;
    end.

!!! Here the name of the file that contains the text of the main program
must be identical with the name that follows the keyword "program".

New type: DWORD - an unsigned 32-bit integer (same as unsigned long in C).
It can be useful in many cases, but keep in mind that during arithmetic
operations between DWORD's and LONGINT's both arguments are casted to
LONGINT's. This may cause an error.

ABSOLUTE may refer to fields of records and objects.  Also, the
address of a global record/object field can be used within the initialization
of typed constants.  Furthermore one can use recursive initialization:

type
  rec = record
          next: ^rec;
          buffer: array [1..10] of char;
          buf_adr: pointer;
        end;

const
  cyclic: rec = (next: @cyclic; buf_adr: @cyclic.buffer);

In initialization of structures and objects the fields may go in
an arbitrary order. If a field is not listed, it is zeroed up.

The syntax of the STR operator has been extended:

    STR (value[:width[:precision]], ..., dest);

Here STR (name:2, ':', ext:3, dst); is equivalent to

        STR (name:2, temp1);
        STR (':',    temp2);
        STR (ext:3,  temp3);
        dst := temp1 + temp2 + temp3;

Negative field widths in WRITE, WRITELN, and STR left align the value within
its field.

!!! The Strings unit contains additional functions which may be more
    convenient than the STR operator.

     Multidimensional open arrays:

You can now use in procedure parameters and functions descriptions
"array (<dim>) of <type>", where <dim> is a positive integer constant, defining
the number of dimensions,  nd <type> is the type of the array elements.
To determine the upper bounds of the array, use the "high (array)" function.
It returns a vector of longints ("array [0..<dim>-1] of longint") containing
the upper bounds. The lower bounds are always set to 0. The vector of the lower
bounds can be obtained with a similar function "low".

Example:

procedure print_vector (v: array (1) of double);
var i: integer;
begin
    for i := 0 to high (v) [0] do write (v [i]:10:6, ' ');

    for i := 0 to high (m) [0] do print_vector (m [i]);
    writeln;

end.

You can find an example program for solving a system of linear equations in
the directory SAMPLES\LIN_EQ.

User defined operations.

TMT Pascal allows redefining of the standard operations on predefined types and ¨
overloading of these operationg for new types. For this, we use the construction

    OVERLOAD:

The syntax is:

    OVERLOAD op_sign = qualified procedure identifier;

Where the op_sign is one of the standard operation symbols:

     + - / * = <> < > <= >= AND OR XOR SHL SHR MOD DIV IN NOT
     +:=   -:=   *:=   /:=

When a re-defined operation is used, TMT Pascal uses the last definition that
could be applied toward operants of given types. For example, this fragment

    FUNCTION add2_rr (a, b:    REAL):    REAL; result := (a + b) * 2;
    FUNCTION add2_ii (a, b: INTEGER): INTEGER; result := (a + b) * 2;

    OVERLOAD + = add_rr;
    OVERLOAD + = add_ii;

redefines the "+" operation. Notice that the order of OVERLOAD's is important.
The reverse order

    OVERLOAD + = add_ii;
    OVERLOAD + = add_rr;

will cause "add_rr" used *always* since integers can always be cast into
reals.

In the SOURCES subdirectory you can find the source of the COMP module which
realizes the complex numbers and defines the operations on them.

Operations +:=, -:=, *:= and /:= have the lowest precedence (lower, than the comparison
operations) and are right-associative. The operations "+:=" and "-:=" are
predefined for all integer and real types; the operations "*:=" and "/:="
are predefined for all real types, with the obvious meaning.

See also description of Strings unit.


     NEW: Iterated typed array constats:

     you can use the notation "..." in the array initialization.
The ellipses should be the last element in the initialization list. If
used, the remaining elements of the array are filled up with the
last given value that preceded the ellipses. Ellipses cannot be the first
element of the initialization list.

Example:

const a: array [1..10, 1..10] of integer = (
    (1,...), (2,...), (3,...), (4, 5, 6, ...), (0, ...), ...
);

fills up the 10 by 10 array as follows:

        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
        2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
        3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
        4 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    3. Incompatibilities:

Procedural values is 8 byte long and has the following format:

0   +-----------------------+
    | The entry point       |
4   +-----------------------+
    | The local environment |
8   +-----------------------+

However, a pointer to a procedure is only 4 byte long and contains only the
address of the entry point. The @ operator verifies that the procedure is
global. Otherwise a range error is generated.

Furthermore, the stack frame structure and parameter passing conventions
differ from those in BP.

Thus the approach used in TVision and CLassLib for writing iterators
cannot be used. However, we offer this correct and reliable (and more
standard) way:

     Type list = object
                     next: ^list;
                     procedure for_all (procedure body (var v));
                 end;

     Procedure list.for_all;
         Var p: ^list;
     Begin
         p := @self;
         repeat
             body (p);
             p := p^.next;
         end;
     End;

     ...

     Type int_list = object (list)
                         value: integer;
                         function first_positive: ^int_list;
                     end;

     Function int_list.first_positive;
         Label OK;
         Var res: ^int_list;
         Procedure do_item (var v);
         Begin
             If int_list (v).value > 0 Then
             Begin
                 res := @v;
                 GoTo OK;
             End
         End;
     Begin
         res := nil;
         for_all (do_item);
     OK:
         first_positive := res;
     End;

     ...



Since in the flat model there are no segments, SEG() always returns 0,
while PTR() ignores its first parameter.

!!! Be careful with these functions: in practice, any use of PTR() or SEG()
    in your program may require a program modification.

Pseudo-array Mem and MemW are used as follows:

    i := MemW [<linear address>]

Note that the segment is not given. Furthermore, the pseudo-arrays
MemD and PortD of type DWORD are available.

See "Memory organization" for more details.


Built-in assembler
------------------

The built-in assembler of TMT Pascal is 32-bit.  It is compatible
with the BP's built-in assembler with the following differences:

Since the program created by Pascal is executed in the flat model,
the far call and jump commands as well as the @Code and @Data symbols
are not implemented.

The ret command:

The ret command without arguments is considered as a ret <parameter block
size> command.  If you need to write the ret command without size you should
set 0 explicitly:

      ret 0

Code-procedure

Besides the assembler-routine you can use the code-routine.  It has the
following differences: the compiler doesn't emit the frame command on
enter and return from the routine (including the ret command), and the local
parameters are based on ESP at the moment of entry.

Example:

    function hi (n: word); code;
    asm
        mov al, byte ptr [n+1]
        ret
    end;


Possible problems during usage
------------------------------

Programs, generated by TMT Pascal abend under OS/2. Correction:
- ensure that in "memory settings" EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT is not equal to 0.
